Routing
====
Step 0: 
  Identify the URL's 

  localhost:4200              -- Home 
  localhost:4200/concepts     -- Concepts 
  localhost:4200/contacts     -- Contact Manager 
  localhost:4200/about        -- About Us

Step 1:
  Let's setup the URL's in menu.comp.html 
  add proper href's 

Step 2: 
  Now, create the components for the URL's 
  ng g c home -is
  ng g c concepts -is 
  ng g c contacts -is 
  ng g c about -is 

Step 3:
  Configure the routes 
  in app-routing.module.ts 

Step 4: 
  In between header and footer, load the appropriate component.
  add the following in app.comp.html 
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>

Step 5:
  Check the app! the component would be loaded in between header and footer. 
  But the page is refreshing. Let's fix it.
  go to menu.comp.html
  replace all href's with routerLink 

Step 6:
  Check the app. It won't refresh the page. But, Active menu should be set
  goto menu.comp.html 
  add routerLinkActive="active"  in all li's 

Step 7:
  Now, Home menu will be active always. 
  in home menu's li add the following 
  [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact:true}"

Step 8:
  Todo: Work on Title
  Prereq: Services, Dependency Injection
