Webapps
----
  1. Server Side Rendering / Traditional Webapps 
      1 Server 
        Front End - (HTML, CSS, JS) + Back End (Dotnet, java) + DB Query

        index.php
          <?php
            echo '<h1>Success</h1>'
          ?>

        Resp: HTML, CSS, JS + Data

        Slower webpages
        Heavy lifting 
        Higher Bandwidth Consumption 
        Expensive

      2 Servers 
        1 Server for the Front End  - 4200 ( will develop this app - Single Page App in Angular)
          HTML, CSS, JS 
          Resp: HTML, CSS, JS - waiting for the data

        1 Server for the Back End  - 8080
